We used the LIKE predicate in two separate cases:

1)When the user is browsing by letter (0-9,A-Z)
	-The selected letter will be sent to the backend
	-backend will use request.getParameter() to retrieve letter
	- used in the following condition:
		- where movies.title LIKE '(Letter)%'
		- this predicate will look for all titles that BEGIN with that letter followed by 0 or more characters

2)When the user is using the search bar or Advanced Search
	-the advanced search options, if submitted with information, will be sent to backend
	- the condition would be:
		- where 'insert_searched_attribute' LIKE '%(substring)%'
		-this predicate will search for all occurrences of that substring within the searched attributes
		-defined by : there are 0 or more characters before the substring and 0 or more characters after the substring
