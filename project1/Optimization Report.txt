Three Parser Results: 

MovieXmlParser : ~45 seconds on AWS to insert

ActorXmlParser : ~3 minutes on AWS to insert 

CastXmlParser : ~12 seconds on AWS to insert

Optimization Tactics:

The optimization tactics we used to decrease the runtime of these parsers is to
reduce as much select statements to reduce the number of database connections as possible.

Also another way to optimize the run time is validate the data as we parse and addbatch to the 
preparedstatement and do batch inserts to decrease time.

Also another thing we did is that we essentially do a 1-pass over the xml parsed information to also reduce speed
and did a batch insert after we finished scanning through the xml information.

Another thing is that we used hashmaps for the casts.xml file to reduce the number of select statements being sent to the database
and decreased runtime by using hashmaps for the star and movies to ensure that both of them exist while we parse through the casts.xml file.
Once done, we also form a similar 1-pass over the xml file to extract the information and then batch insert once the parser is done.
